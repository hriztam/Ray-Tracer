So raytracking involves quite a bit of math and geometry. There are two practical ways:-

- We could either simualte rays and check if they hit an object and if they do then we cast a shadow
- The alternative would be to define objects and calculate tangents based of them

We would go with the second one, because it would computationally be more efficient
